      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p><img src="img/rocking.jpg" alt="Rocky story"></p>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas Sudbury School is a 21st-century school in Baltimore where
      students ages 5 through 18 learn, explore, and grow in a stimulating,
      supportive community.</p>
      <p>The school is based on a philosophy of education first pioneered by the
      Sudbury Valley School in 1968 and now operating in more than 40 schools
      worldwide. A&amp;I was founded in 2008 by two parents, also professors who,
      inspired by the Sudbury model of education, wanted to start a school for their
      own children and the Baltimore community. Before starting Arts &amp; Ideas, the
      founders were involved with pre-school groups that were focused on what
      children naturally do best - play! While observing their own young children
      grow and learn, the founders recognized that play - which is how all children
      learn to interpret and manage their world - should not stop when a child turns 5.
      They wanted a school where play (which we define as any activity with no
      known outcome) was not squashed, or limited to a certain amount of time per
      day, or only available to the youngest students. Instead, they wanted a school
      that celebrated and encouraged play for all students of all ages. After years
      of planning and researching, Arts &amp; Ideas opened its doors in 2008 in a small
      rented space with just 9 students.</p>
      <p>The school first opened in the upstairs hall of the Church of the Messiah in
      the Hamilton/Lauraville neighborhood of Northeast Baltimore. While the space
      at the church was lovely - bright, welcoming, and warm - the school quickly
      began to outgrow the available square footage there. Another obstacle at the
      church was the sharing of space - other groups used some of our rooms, meaning
      we had to either keep them relatively empty or clear them out at the end of
      each day. Because of these sharing arrangements, and the fact that we were
      renters, we could never truly make the space “ours.”</p>
      <p>In the third year of the school, the A&amp;I community started to search for a new
      home - a permanent location where the school would have the freedom to mold
      and shape the space without limitations. After countless visits to potential
      buildings and hours of planning meetings, A&amp;I finally entered into a lease for
      a large church building in the Mt. Washington neighborhood of Baltimore. The
      school existed in this building for one year (our 6th year), but when it came
      time to re-sign the lease after 12 months, the church decided that they wanted
      to sell the building instead of continuing to rent it out. While we did have
      the option to purchase this building, we decided not to - mainly due to the
      fact that it needed immense structural work that would be enormously
      expensive.</p>
      <p>So, we said goodbye to Mt. Washington and came back to our original home at
      the Church of the Messiah to regroup and plan our next step. Throughout year
      7, the A&amp;I community (parents, staff, and students) worked tirelessly to
      secure our true &quot;forever home&quot;. Finally, in the fall of our 8th year,
      Arts &amp; Ideas purchased our very own building!</p>
      <p><img src="img/victory-gym.jpg" alt="Victorious arrival"></p>
      <p>Now in our eighth year, Arts &amp; Ideas is a thriving community with over 50
      students of all ages working together to create, maintain, and nourish a free
      and democratic school culture in our new building!</p>
