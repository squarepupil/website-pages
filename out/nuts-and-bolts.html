      <h1>Nuts and Bolts</h1>
      <h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
      <h5 id="how-is-the-school-governed-and-run">How is the school governed and run?</h5>
      <p><img src="img/whiteboard.jpg" alt="Paneling"></p>
      <p>The overarching governing body of the school is School Meeting, which is
      comprised of all enrolled students and staff. Each member of School Meeting
      (each individual student and staff member) is called a School Meeting Member,
      or SMM. School Meeting convenes once a week to vote on decisions related to
      running the school, such as rule changes, deletions, or additions, spending
      proposals from the school budget, visitor approvals, and more. Every SMM has
      one vote in every decision that we make (although most voting matters are not
      mandatory), regardless of the type or magnitude of the decision - from what
      supplies to stock the art room with to which staff we should hire.</p>
      <p>While School Meeting creates and edits the rules and policies of the school as
      needed, Judicial Committee (JC) enforces all the rules in our law book. JC
      works in a similar way to jury duty; it is a rotating group of students and
      staff that serve together on the committee for one week at a time. Serving on
      JC is a requirement of all SMM’s, from the 5 year olds to the staff. JC meets
      every day to handle cases, or “write ups.” A write up happens when any SMM
      (child or adult) believes that another SMM (child or adult) has broken a rule
      from the law book. When this happens, the plaintiff retrieves a write up form
      and records the details of the incident. The case is usually heard the next
      day in JC, which is run much like a small court - all testimony from both
      sides is heard, evidence is presented, and JC makes two decisions by vote: was
      a rule actually broken, and if it was, what should be done about it? We call
      these consequences “sentences,” and the range varies depending on the case and
      the rule broken. Some examples of sentences might include a warning, having to
      wipe down the lunchroom tables if a mess was left out, being banned from a
      room or supply if it was used incorrectly.</p>
      <p>There is a third governing body of the school called Assembly, which includes
      all School Meeting Members (staff and students) as well as all the parents.
      Assembly votes on decisions outside of the day to day running of the school,
      such as tuition and staff salary. Assembly meets once a year in the spring to
      approve the school budget and take care of any other needed business.</p>
      <h5 id="how-does-graduation-work">How does graduation work?</h5>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas, like most Sudbury Schools, offers a diploma process involving a
      written thesis and defense process for those students aged 16+ who choose to
      undertake it. By November of their graduation year, students intending to
      graduate must declare that intent and begin to prepare their thesis to answer
      the question, ‘How have I prepared to enter the world beyond school?’
      Throughout the year and with the help of an advisory committee, the student
      works to prepare a written piece explaining their answer, as well as any other
      supplemental materials (be they written, performed, or otherwise documented)
      to help support their case. In the springtime, a panel of staff members from
      neighboring Sudbury schools convenes to hear the student’s thesis and defense.
      The panel then votes to grant or deny a diploma. Whether or not the diploma is
      granted, the student may choose to graduate and move on to the next stage in
      their life. In the event that they are denied the diploma and are still 18 or
      younger, they may continue to attend Arts &amp; Ideas and attempt the diploma
      process again in the following year. The diploma process is not mandatory and,
      as long as a student is of age to leave school, they need not necessarily
      undertake it to graduate. It is an optional process that many, but not all,
      teenagers who are leaving the school wish to undertake, often as a capstone of
      their experience at the school.</p>
      <p>The diploma granted by Arts &amp; Ideas is not a legally recognized high school
      diploma, although it is usually quite an impressive document that students can
      use for college or job applications. Some students do choose to pursue a GED
      while they are enrolled as well, although many do not as they are not usually
      required for college admissions or hiring.</p>

      <h5 id="do-you-accept-students-with-disabilities">Do you accept students with disabilities?</h5>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas enrolls students with disabilities on a case-by-case basis.
      Regardless of any disability, all students need to be able to be independent,
      keep themselves safe without constant adult supervision, and handle their own
      needs (such as eating and going to the bathroom). While we do not provide any
      specific accommodations for students with disabilities (like occupational
      therapy or speech services, for example), we have had many students who
      required services or medications in previous education settings do just fine
      here. In many ways, every student at A&amp;I is on their own IEP (Individualized
      Education Plan), in that they have the space, time, and freedom to be
      themselves and learn in whatever way makes sense for them. We have had many
      students achieve great success at Arts &amp; Ideas that have been diagnosed with
      Autism, Dyslexia, ADD, ADHD, Emotional or other Mood disorders, among others.</p>
      <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
      <h5 id="year-round">Year round?</h5>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas operates with a schedule similar to neighboring public schools,
      including summer vacation, winter break, and spring break. See our calendar
      for more information.</p>
      <h5 id="hours">Hours?</h5>
      <p>The school is open from 8:15 AM - 5:45 PM. To receive credit for a full day of
      attendance, students are required to be present for a total of at least 5
      hours, and those 5 hours must include the core hours of 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM.
      The school offers extended drop-off and pick-up hours from 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
      for an additional fee for those families who consistently require it.</p>
      <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
      <h5 id="what-resources-are-available-at-school">What resources are available at school?</h5>
      <p><img src="img/meetings.jpg" alt="Meetings"></p>
      <p>Just like our law book, the resources available at school ebb and flow based
      on current student interests. Over the years, we have amassed certain
      consistently popular resources. These include our robust Music Room, which
      boasts many instruments as well as professional recording equipment and
      amplifiers. Our Art Room is well stocked with paints, crayons, pencils,
      markers, paper of all kinds, a sewing machine, fabric, hot glue guns, yard and
      knitting needles, stickers, stamps, clay...and more! The Video Room is where
      students can use professional video equipment to record stop animation shorts
      or live action videos. Many students also enjoy editing videos and exploring
      the animation process with our access to advanced editing software. Our
      commercial kitchen is fully decked out with pizza ovens, industrial fridges
      and freezers, a deep fryer, ice machine, and separate dishwashing room. The
      library is bursting with books suitable for all types and ages of readers; we
      also have a parent library full of books about or related to the Sudbury model
      that are free to borrow. Our gym room has a junior kip bar, practice balance
      beam, yoga mats, and gymnastics mats to create a safe space for flipping and
      tumbling. We have lots of science equipment, including bunsen burners, scales,
      and glassware. As the school continues to grow and settle into it’s new home,
      we can’t wait to see how our students continue to fill it with all their
      ideas!</p>
      <h5 id="field-trips">Field trips?</h5>
      <p>We love taking field trips at Arts &amp; Ideas. Some trips are primarily planned
      and executed by staff, while others are largely coordinated by students. Just
      a few field trips we’ve gone on over the years include: taking the light rail
      to the Baltimore Aquarium, listening to all kinds of concerts at The Peabody,
      seeing plays at The Theatre Project, exploring for treasures and learning more
      about the ecosystem at the nearby Herring Run Park, hiking, overnight camping
      at the beach in Delaware, and engaging in all kinds of outdoor fun at Camp
      Puh’Tok.</p>
      <h5 id="daily-activities">Daily activities?</h5>
      <p><img src="img/gunning.jpg" alt="Fake Guns Allowed"></p>
      <p>As you might imagine, daily activities at Arts &amp; Ideas are widely varied from
      student to student, day to day. On any given day at school, you might see
      students climbing trees in the yard, eating lunch on the front steps, planning
      and cooking for a bake sale at school, playing minecraft in the computer lab,
      practicing coding or animation skills on laptops, recording a new song in the
      music room, scripting and holding auditions for a play, filming a stop
      animation short in the video room, conversing about current events with staff
      in the office, walking to the nearby coffee shop for a hot chocolate, chatting
      and laughing with friends on a comfy couch in a sunny spot, researching an
      interesting topic on the internet, reading, writing stories or preparing a
      poem for Poetry Club, creating comic books, building a dollhouse, trying to
      fix a broken computer, or building a hamster track out of blocks. Come back
      the next day and you’ll probably see a whole new set of activities!</p>
