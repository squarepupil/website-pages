      <ul>
      <li>How does graduation work?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas, like all Sudbury Schools, offers a diploma process involving a thesis and defense for those students aged 16+ who choose to undertake it. By November of their graduation year, students intending to graduate must declare that intent and begin to prepare their thesis to answer the question, ‘How have I prepared to enter the world beyond school?’ Throughout the year and with the help of a staff adviser, the student works to prepare a written piece explaining their answer, as well as any other materials (be they written, performed, or otherwise documented) to help support their case. In the springtime, a panel of staff members from neighboring Sudbury schools convenes to hear the student’s thesis and defense, which then votes to grant or deny a diploma. Whether or not the diploma is granted, the student may choose to graduate and move on to the next stage in their life. In the event that they are denied the diploma and are still 18 or younger, they may continue to attend Arts &amp; Ideas and attempt the diploma process again in the following year. The diploma process is not mandatory and, as long as a student is of age to leave school, they need not necessarily undertake it to graduate. - Phil</p>
      <h2 id="admissions">Admissions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>How do we enroll?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first step is an interview in which you and our admissions clerks will discuss the school, the model, and expectations. Assuming all goes well with that, the next step is a visiting week to see if it is a good fit with the community. If that goes well, then enrollment can be done immediately after the visiting week or any convenient time thereafter.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What’s a visiting week?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A visiting week allows a prospective student, who has already completed a family interview, to attend the school for a week to experience the ins and outs of a school day at Arts &amp; Ideas. The week allows for both the prospective student and the school to get to know each other to make an informed admissions decision. Prospective students on visiting week are required to attend School Meeting on the day it takes place and Judicial Committee for at least 30 minutes over the course of the week. Other than these requirements a student on visiting week is free to avail themselves of the school as any other enrolled student would. The visiting week costs $125. - Phil</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What is tuition?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tuition for the 2015-16 school year is $6,125 for the first student, $4,595 for the second, and $3,450 for the third. Because the school admits students on a rolling basis, tuition is calculated on a prorated basis. - Phil</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Is there financial aid?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Financial aid is available to those who apply, including those whose children enroll mid-year. - Phil</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What is the Parent Equity Program?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Parent Equity Program is a fundraising program designed to facilitate the school’s move from its former rented location to the current owned facilities (as of November 2015). The program was formulated for the school by a consultant exclusively specializing in independent schools and honed and approved by a vote of the School Assembly (the decision making body which includes parents). As approved by School Assembly, participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all enrolled families. - Phil</p>
      <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Year round?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas operates with a schedule similar to neighboring public schools, including summer vacation. See our calendar. - Phil</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Hours?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The school is open from 8:15 AM - 5:45 PM. Students are required to be present for a total of 5 hours, including the core hours of 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM, to receive credit for a full day’s attendance. The school offers extended drop-off and pick-up hours from 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM for an additional fee for those families who consistently require it. - Phil</p>

      <ul>
      <li>What do the teachers teach?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have no teachers. The adults employed by the school are staff. They may teach students something just as adults might teach each other something on occasion. But their primary role is not to be teachers. And more often than not, the staff get to be learners. Children are so curious.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What do staff do?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anything and everything. Often, they seem to mainly be there to be interrupted. The staff do what needs to be done to make sure the school keeps running, is safe, is supportive of student needs, and answer many questions.</p>
