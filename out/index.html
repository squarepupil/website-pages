      <p>Children are amazing people. They are growing bundles of energy, exploring
      life and all of its many complexities.</p>
      <p>The natural mode of learning for children is play. Play is their way to model
      reality. Just as scientists work with models to study aspects of a situation,
      children take aspects of life and play with them in order to understand them.
      Along the way, they practice communication, problem-solving, leadership, and
      creativity, as well as reading, writing, and math.</p>
      <p>As they play and learn, children also practice how to express and cope with
      the range of human emotions. They learn from their own experiences and help
      each other journey through moments of joy, sadness, compassion, anger, and
      other strong emotions that can take years to master.</p>
      <p>How do we know all this? Because we see this every day at our school. Our
      children are given the freedom to be children and thus, they learn to be
      adults.  They make their own decisions about what to do and how to fit into
      their own authentic community.</p>
      <p>What do children do at our school?  They are playing, socializing, thinking
      and observing, planning events, and doing projects of their own. They may be
      engaged in gymnastics, programming, fort-building, mathematics, painting,
      video editing, musical instrument playing, woodworking, writing, dancing,
      storytelling, history, reading, Minecraft-ing, and whatever else strikes their
      fancy at the moment.  Learning is highly individualized and varies from person
      to person and from moment to moment.</p>
      <p>Regardless of specific activities our children pursue, what they are truly
      learning is how to learn.  This core learning explains how generations of
      Sudbury students, many of whom have never taken a formal class, thrive both at
      college and in the working world.  They have learned how to focus, how to
      explore, how to ask questions, how to master something that interests them,
      and how to take failure as well as success in stride as steps towards
      achieving their own goals.</p>
      <p>The children and staff are all members of the school community and learn from
      one another. The staff ensure that the school environment is safe,
      appropriately supportive, and run in a democratic fashion.  All school members
      have equal rights, which means having equal voice in both making the rules and
      adjudicating them. We have found that children of all ages treat this process
      seriously, and their ensuing discussions balance the needs of the community
      with compassion for their peers, leading to respectful outcomes for all
      involved.</p>
      <p>Explore our website to see and understand how we honor children and their
      amazing capacities to fully engage in meaningful learning experiences.
      Alternative education takes a whole new meaning at our school with our focus
      on learning instead of teaching.</p>
