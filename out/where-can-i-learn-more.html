      <p>Explore the innovations and trends that could bring about the biggest
      transformation in teaching since the beginning of mass education.</p>
      <p>Sudbury Valley School Online Library (<a href="http://sudval.org">sudval.org</a>) At Sudbury Valley School,
      students from preschool through high school age explore the world freely, at
      their own pace and in their own unique ways. They learn to think for
      themselves, and learn to use Information Age tools to unearth the knowledge
      they need from multiple sources. They develop the ability to make clear
      logical arguments, and deal with complex ethical issues. Through
      self-initiated activities, they pick up the basics; as they direct their
      lives, they take responsibility for outcomes, set priorities, allocate
      resources, and work with others in a vibrant community.</p>

      <p>Sir Ken Robinson (<a href="http://sirkenrobinson.com">sirkenrobinson.com</a>) &quot;Creativity expert Sir Ken Robinson
      challenges the way we're educating our children. He champions a radical
      rethink of our school systems, to cultivate creativity and acknowledge
      multiple types of intelligence...&quot;We are educating people out of their
      creativity,&quot; Robinson says... Robinson's TEDTalk has been distributed widely
      around the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing
      blog posts on his talk? &quot;Everyone should watch this.&quot;&quot; - TED (Technology,

      <h3 id="a-mathematicians-lament">A Mathematician's Lament</h3>
      <p>A Mathematician's Lament, was written by Paul
      Lockhart in 2002. Mr. Lockhart is a mathematics teacher at Saint Ann's School
      in Brooklyn, New York. The Mathematical Association of America featured &quot;A
      Mathematicians Lament&quot; in a column by mathematician Keith Devlin who is the
      Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Language and Information at
      Stanford University and The Math Guy on NPR's Weekend Edition.</p>
      <p>&quot;And there you have it. A complete prescription for permanently disabling
      young minds— a proven cure for curiosity. What have they done to mathematics!
      There is such breathtaking depth and heartbreaking beauty in this ancient art
      form. How ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the antithesis of
      creativity. They are missing out on an art form older than any book, more
      profound than any poem, and more abstract than any abstract. And it is school
      that has done this! What a sad endless cycle of innocent teachers inflicting
      damage upon innocent students. We could all be having so much more fun.&quot;</p>
