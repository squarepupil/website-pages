      <p>Note: This page is a reprint of a publication produced by Fairhaven School
      Incorporated and is reproduced here with their permission.</p>
      <p>By Romey Pittman, Fairhaven parent, co-founder and former staff member.</p>
      <p>After hearing a short explanation of our school's philosophy, many people
      understandably try to link it with something already familiar to them. The
      most frequently mentioned &quot;so-you're-sort-of-likes&quot; are listed below. We have
      tried to be fair, but clear, in distinguishing ourselves from other
      philosophies. However, all the subtleties of these educational models are not
      laid out and comparisons are not made from every angle. We hope that the
      explanations below serve to clarify what the Sudbury model is really about,
      and what it is not.</p>
      <p>... A MONTESSORI SCHOOL?  There are some ways in which the Sudbury model is
      similar to the Montessori approach. Children in both settings are allowed more
      freedom to make decisions about what interests them and how to pace themselves
      than in most other schools. Both models also hold the basic assumption that
      children are naturally curious and don't need to be forced to learn. But
      Montessori children may choose only between the specific options presented by
      the teacher, not from the full array of activities which life itself presents.
      Montessori educators believe that all children learn according to specific
      patterns and sequences. They base classroom activities on the model's
      assumptions about what is &quot;developmentally appropriate&quot; for each age group,
      and restrict access to certain activities if earlier activities in the
      preplanned sequence have not been completed. The Sudbury model makes no
      assumptions about how individual children will learn at any age. There is no
      expectation that one learn multiplication before negative numbers or how to
      draw a circle before a square. Interest is the only criterion for engaging in
      any activity, and satisfaction the only evaluation of success.</p>
      <p>... A WALDORF SCHOOL?  Like Waldorf schools, Sudbury schools care about the
      whole child. We are not only interested in academic success, but in the
      happiness and full human potential of each individual. Like Waldorf schools,
      we do not push children to read early, as traditional schools do. We both
      value play, &quot;deep&quot; (intensely involved) play, in particular, as crucial to the
      development of children's mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual selves,
      indeed as the fundamental &quot;work&quot; of children. We both respect the intuitive
      wisdom of children, and take their world views and interests quite seriously.
      But the Sudbury model espouses no particular path of spiritual or emotional
      growth. Rather than listening to children in order to better guide them, we
      listen to them to respond to their self-determined needs. Unlike Waldorf
      education, we have no predetermined curriculum. We trust children to make
      their own mistakes, work through their own problems, and come to their own
      solutions, with help, when it's needed, but without the assumption that we
      know the best outcome. Waldorf educators endeavor to move children, and
      society in general, in a particular direction, and seek to set up an
      environment which fosters such social transformation. By contrast, Sudbury
      schools seek to create an environment where children can recognize and pursue
      their own agenda. Children and adults together assess and modify the culture
      of the school through the School Meeting. The democratic process in a Sudbury
      school can be loud and contentious; it involves special interest groups
      politicking, voters making judgments, defendants being sentenced. It is &quot;real&quot;
      and not necessarily &quot;enlightened&quot; (although always respectful). The Sudbury
      model simply aims to give children access to the full complexity of life, and
      the curiosity, confidence, and competence to participate in -- and perhaps to
      change -- society according to their own interests, experience, knowledge, and
      goals.</p>
      <p>... A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL?  Sudbury schools believe, as progressive school
      reformers do, that traditional schooling is not working. Both identify
      authoritarian teaching and administration as problems, and seek to reduce the
      stresses students experience in being coerced into learning and evaluated by
      &quot;objective&quot; testing. But the Sudbury model also rejects the notion that the
      alternative to authoritarianism is permissiveness -- kind teachers giving kids
      second and third chances to shape up, trying to prevent any unhappiness, and
      bending over backwards to &quot;make learning fun,&quot; getting children to learn
      without them noticing they are learning. When kids are treated permissively
      they do not learn personal responsibility for their actions. Adults in
      progressive schools are still retaining the authority to grant or deny that
      second chance, to step in to resolve disputes, to establish the rules of
      conduct in their schools. There can be an illusion of freedom or democratic
      decision-making in progressive school, but if kids make poor decisions, adults
      always retain the power to step in and solve the problem for them. In the
      context of learning, progressive schools often try to have the curriculum
      follow students' interests. But the effect of teaching to a child's interests
      is, as Daniel Greenberg has argued, like a parent waiting for a child to open
      her mouth to speak before popping in the medicine the parent wants to give
      her. Children who show an interest playing Cowboys and Indians for a few
      hours, might be subject to six weeks worth of projects about Native Americans,
      regardless of whether their interest is sustained or not. The child
      administered medicine in such a manner may learn never to open her mouth
      around a parent with a spoon; the student administered education in such a
      manner may learn not to show interest, at least in school. Learning something
      new can be hard work, and children are quite capable of hard work -- when they
      are working on something they want to do. When a student has a serious
      interest, there is no stopping her, and &quot;making it fun&quot; is often an
      intolerable distraction. When a student has an interest, we believe she should
      be allowed to pursue it only as far as she feels necessary. She may return to
      an important idea later, to deepen her interest, but forcing or manipulating
      her to deepen it will only serve to lessen her curiosity and sense of
      self-determination. Some progressive schools offer an array of courses, but do
      not require attendance. Sudbury schools do not have standard offerings,
      because learning to pursue one's own agenda can be challenging, sometimes
      painful, sometimes boring. We think boredom is a valuable opportunity to make
      discoveries about one's self. It is often easier to sit in classes, be
      entertained (maybe not as well as TV entertains, but still better than
      nothing), and avoid parental pressure, than it is to schedule one's own life,
      wrestle with one's own questions, learn how to seek the answers, and master
      one's own destiny.</p>
      <p>... HOMESCHOOLING?  There is a particular philosophy of homeschooling, often
      referred to as &quot;unschooling,&quot; which shares many similarities with the Sudbury
      model. John Holt was its best known proponent, and his writings have been
      invaluable to us in helping to explain just how learning can happen without
      teaching, and why on earth a child might choose to learn arithmetic or some
      other supposedly dreadful subject. Unschoolers believe, as we do, that
      children are born curious about the world and eager to succeed in life and
      that kids learn best through experience and experimentation rather than by
      being told how and what to think. In the words of John Holt: &quot;Real learning is
      a process of discovery, and if we want it to happen, we must create the kinds
      of conditions in which discoveries are made. . . They include time, freedom,
      and a lack of pressure.&quot; But unschoolers, for the most part, see the family
      environment as the best place for children to grow, while the Sudbury model
      believes that, as the African proverb states, &quot;It takes a village to raise a
      child.&quot; Children and parents have complex relationships and interdependencies
      which make it harder for children to discover true independence within the
      family. In the environment of a Sudbury school, children face direct personal
      responsibility for their actions, without the emotional baggage that
      family-based accountability can sometimes carry. In addition, children are
      more able to develop some important social skills in a democratic school --
      the ability to tolerate diversity of opinion, to speak out against
      inappropriate behavior, and to develop and carry out group projects, for
      example. In most homeschooling families, the parent sees him or herself as
      ultimately responsible for the child's education, while at Sudbury schools,
      that responsibility rests squarely with the child.</p>
      <p>... STUDENT GOVERNMENTS IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS?  Sudbury School Meetings are
      similar to student governments only in that they are composed of students. But
      the School Meeting is a participatory democracy, where every student and staff
      member has the option of a direct vote in every decision made. Student
      governments are representative -- students are chosen to represent the larger
      student body. More importantly, student governments are hardly ever given real
      power over substantive issues. Elected positions serve primarily as symbols of
      status, popularity, and &quot;leadership potential&quot; for college admissions
      purposes. The School Meeting decides who will be staff each year, how tuition
      will be spent, what each and every rule of the school will be, and who will be
      suspended or expelled for violation of those rules. Staff members are involved
      on an equal footing, arguing their positions with gusto. But they are also
      equally bound to the rules of the school. As a free majority, students
      experience real control over their lives at school, and real consequences if
      they fail to meet the responsibilities such control requires of them. That
      kind of government brings a community identity and sense of individual
      empowerment no token school government could hope to achieve.</p>
