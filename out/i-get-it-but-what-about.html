      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>reading?</p>
      <p>Children learn to read in a variety of ways at their own timing. Some learn at
      age 4 and others learn when they are 9. When they learn, they learn quickly.
      By letting them find their own way, their joy of reading is undiminished.</p>
      <p>Reading is a basic skill of our society and children are highly motivated to
      acquire that skill as it is such a basic part of everyone's daily needs.</p>
      <p><a href="http://schoolingtheworld.org/a-thousand-rivers/">A Thousand Rivers</a> is an
      excellent article on gaining a proper perspective on children learning to
      read on their own.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>math?</p>
      <p>Much like reading, basic arithmetic is a useful skill that children pick up as
      they need it. They use numbers in daily life, such as dealing with money,
      dividing up stuff, etc, and they get a natural feeling for their use.</p>
      <p>The more advanced mathematics is not picked up naturally, but they are easily
      learned when there is need. There is ample evidence of this in the history of
      Sudbury schools. For example, college entrance tests require some mathematical
      knowledge which Sudbury students pick up in a few months of dedicated effort.</p>
      <p>Our model also has the additional feature that none of our students learn to
      fear or hate mathematics. Instead, they see it as a tool that they can master
      just as they can master any skill that they need.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>college?</p>
      <p>The admissions process of colleges varies and student experience will vary as
      well, but the experience to date is that students who wish to go to college do
      not have problems. If there are tests that need taking, they prepare for them.
      If there are prerequisites that they can fill, they do so. If not, they talk
      their way around them.</p>
      <p>As with most roles in society, being accepted is more a matter of personality
      and clarity of thought rather than a simple list of skills. Our students can
      easily talk with adults. They have a focus and clearness derived from years of
      negotiating a complex and ever-changing society.</p>
      <p>Once admitted, they also do not seem to have problems with the courses. While
      they may have never taken a course before, they are well-equipped to learn
      what they need to learn in order to succeed at college. They can easily talk
      with professors and resource centers. They work hard at it as they know why
      they are there.</p>
      <p>They are also not distracted by the social scene at college. They have have
      had many years of socializing and that is not the novelty of college for them.
      For Sudbury students, college is a place to learn academic material that they
      believe will be of use to them in their chosen path in life. Thus, they work
      hard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>accreditation?</p>
      <p>We are a licensed and recognized school in Maryland. Our standing suffices
      to meet the obligatory attendance requirement for school.</p>
      <p>We are not accredited. To be accredited, we would need to follow a
      standardized curriculum which is antithetical to our model.</p>
      <p>Accreditation may matter for certain goals, such as playing in collegiate
      athletics. Even here, however, there may be options such as participating
      in an online accredited school.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>screen time?</p>
      <p>Students use computers quite a bit. Some parents have issues with that.
      Let us be clear. We will not limit student screen time.</p>
      <p>We trust students to choose an appropriate path to mastering what they
      feel they need to master. Playing is how they learn and that is no
      different on a computer. We all know that computer skills are absolutely
      essential in the current economy. What better way to become comfortable
      with their use than by</p>
