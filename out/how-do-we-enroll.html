      <h1>How do we enroll?</h1>
      <h4 id="step-0-open-house">Step 0: Open house</h4>
      <p>Although they are not mandatory steps for enrollment, we do encourage families
      considering enrollment at Arts &amp; Ideas to attend an open house, especially if
      they are unfamiliar with our model of education. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rbowCIad1VC8l_GOoP-0gcIBhH8DXWnw1RzbobY6q4w/viewform">To access our current open
      house schedule, please click
      here!</a></p>
      <h4 id="step-1-schedule-an-interview">Step 1: Schedule an interview</h4>
      <p>The interview is a chance not only for us to get to know you and your
      family, but for you to get to know us and ask us questions about the
      school. You will also get a tour of the space, and since interviews
      typically take place during the school day, you can see how the school
      operates. Interviews typically last about an hour, but we are happy to
      take as much time as you need to make sure all questions are answered.</p>
      <p>You can set up an interview by either emailing us at <a href="mailto:aisudburyschool@gmail.com">aisudburyschool@gmail.com</a>
      or by giving us a call at 410-426-0001.</p>
      <h4 id="step-2-visiting-week">Step 2: Visiting week</h4>
      <p>Once the interview has been completed, the next step towards enrollment is
      the visiting week. This is where the student wishing to enroll attends school for
      5 full days (typically Monday-Friday). At the end of the visiting week,
      we will meet with your family again to answer
      any questions that came up, talk about how the week went,
      and go over the contract of enrollment.</p>
      <h4 id="step-3-enrollment">Step 3: Enrollment!</h4>
      <p>With a great visiting week done, enrollment can begin immediately. We will go
      over in detail in person what is needed, but you will be entering a tuition
      contract with us guaranteeing payment for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>It is very important to be committed to staying through the year. Our students
      undertake a difficult journey, one in which they are responsible for their
      choices. Most incoming students are not used to this and it is often
      surprisingly hard. They also may be decompressing from earlier environments.
      As all of this shakes out, the most important element that a parent can bring
      to the discussion is the assertion that the student needs to keep attending
      the school. While our students love attending our school in general, there are
      times when it is important that they have to stick it out.</p>
      <p>This is the role of the contract in our school. To join us is to make a
      commitment.</p>
      <p>In addition, as discussed in person, tuition and the parent equity share are
      due upon enrollment though we can accommodate a flexible payment plan.</p>
      <h5 id="step-4-join-our-community">Step 4: Join our community</h5>
      <p>Once formally enrolled, it is important to keep the lines of communication
      open. This model of education requires an adjustment both for the student and
      the family as a whole. We have a great deal of experience helping families
      through the adjustment. Additionally, our current parents have been there and
      are happy to support new parents through the transition.</p>
      <p>In addition to linking parents up directly, we also hold parent talk abouts
      where we gather, eat, and discuss our experiences and trials.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="nuts-and-bolts.md">attendance policy</a>, while flexible, is also intended
      to ensure the student becomes a full member of our community.</p>
