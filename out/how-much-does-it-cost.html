      <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
      <p>There are two main financial obligations to enrolling at Arts &amp; Ideas: tuition
      and the Parent Equity Program. Besides these costs, there are no other
      mandatory financial obligations to enrolling (no textbook or uniform fees, for
      example).</p>
      <h3 id="tuition">Tuition</h3>
      <p>Current tuition is $6,125 per year for the first child in a family, $4,595
      for the second, and $3,450 for any additional children. Tuition is decided
      each year by majority vote of the Arts &amp; Ideas Assembly which consists
      of parents, staff, and students. For students enrolling part way through
      the school year, tuition is prorated to reflect the amount of school time
      they will be using.</p>
      <h3 id="parent-equity-program">Parent Equity Program</h3>
      <p><img src="img/building.jpg" alt="Owning a building needs capital"></p>
      <p>The Parent Equity Program is a capital raising program designed to facilitate
      the schoolâ€™s move from its former rented location to the current owned
      facilities (as of November 2015). The program was formulated by
      the A&amp;I Assembly with the help of a consultant exclusively specializing in
      independent schools.  As approved by the
      Assembly, participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all
      enrolled families. The program is very similar to ones that many other
      self-funding schools use; the details of the PEP are discussed during the
      family interview.</p>
      <h3 id="payment-plans">Payment Plans</h3>
      <p>While the enrollment contract holds each family accountable for full tuition
      payments, we do have the flexibility to offer payment plans for those that
      need or prefer them. Typically, we offer two plans: a 9 month plan where
      families pay a chunk of tuition monthly during the school year only, or a 12
      month plan where families can pay less per month by spreading payments out
      over the summer. We work with each family individually to figure out the best
      solution for everyone.</p>
      <h3 id="financial-aid">Financial Aid</h3>
      <p>Arts &amp; Ideas is committed to making our school available and accessible to all
      families who are ready to enroll and thus have a financial aid program
      available to enrolled and eligible families. Financial aid is handled on a
      private, case by case basis by our Financial Aid Committee.</p>
