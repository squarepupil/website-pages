      <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
      <p>Current tuition is $6,125 for the first student in a family, $4,595 for the
      second, and $3,450 for each additional student.</p>
      <p>We do have a Financial Aid program for eligible enrolled families.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the school requires families to participate in our Parent Equity
      Program. We discuss the details of this program in the interview.
      This is what allowed the community to support and fund the purchase of
      the school's permanent home.</p>
      <h3 id="payment-policy">Payment policy</h3>
      <p>Students may enroll at any time during the school year, subject to
      availability. In order to build a stable environment at the school and a
      successful experience for each student, it is important that each family trust
      the process of self-initiated learning and commit to the long-term process of
      community building. Accordingly, we emphasize the importance that all students
      and parents must be willing to commit to the school for the duration of the
      academic year. Students often need time to adjust to a new environment and
      different expectations.</p>
      <p>While we encourage families to remit payment for the full year’s tuition upon
      enrollment, we understand the preference for some families to participate in
      one of our two monthly installment payment plans. Since A&amp;I is a small school,
      continued operations rely heavily upon timely payment of tuition by all
      attending families. Accordingly, a late fee will be charged for all late
      payments. As we truly enjoy seeing our students every day, we request that
      families keep their account current so that the student’s do not need to
      disrupt their attendance.</p>
      <h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>
      <p>The general financial decisions are decided by majority
      vote of the Arts &amp; Ideas Assembly - composed of students, parents, and staff -
      in its spring meeting.</p>
      <p>This includes setting th tuition, the parent equity requirement, and the
      budgeted amount of financial aid.</p>
