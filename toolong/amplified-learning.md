Amplified Learning
---

A community of students, when given the freedom to explore on their own,
naturally gravitate to group learning and exploration. This is quite
remarkable given how difficult group work is in a traditional school setting. 

The difference is, of course, that there is joy and interest in what they do
at our school. That joy is infectious and leads to students exploring areas
and directions that they would not have thought to do so on their own.
Ultimately, their own interests dominate, but only after lengthy periods of
exploring other student's interests. 

During that time of joint exploration, there is teaching from one to the other
as well as inspirations from all sides. This is amplified learning and it
happens constantly at our school. 

It also is when the greatest shouts of glee and joy happen. There is something
deeply social about our species. As we work together, we feed on that social
energy, and thrive on it. Our brains explode with ideas and joy. 

Our learning here can be loud and boisterous.
