* reading? 

    Children learn to read in a variety of ways at their own timing. Some learn at
    age 4 and others learn when they are 9. When they learn, they learn quickly.
    By letting them find their own way, their joy of reading is undiminished. 

    Reading is a basic skill of our society and children are highly motivated to
    acquire that skill as it is such a basic part of everyone's daily needs. 

    [A Thousand Rivers](http://schoolingtheworld.org/a-thousand-rivers/) is an
    excellent article on gaining a proper perspective on children learning to
    read on their own. 

* math? 

    Much like reading, basic arithmetic is a useful skill that children pick up as
    they need it. They use numbers in daily life, such as dealing with money,
    dividing up stuff, etc, and they get a natural feeling for their use. 

    The more advanced mathematics is not picked up naturally, but they are easily
    learned when there is need. There is ample evidence of this in the history of
    Sudbury schools. For example, college entrance tests require some mathematical
    knowledge which Sudbury students pick up in a few months of dedicated effort. 

    Our model also has the additional feature that none of our students learn to
    fear or hate mathematics. Instead, they see it as a tool that they can master
    just as they can master any skill that they need. 

* college? 

    The admissions process of colleges varies and student experience will vary as
    well, but the experience to date is that students who wish to go to college do
    not have problems. If there are tests that need taking, they prepare for them.
    If there are prerequisites that they can fill, they do so. If not, they talk
    their way around them. 

    As with most roles in society, being accepted is more a matter of personality
    and clarity of thought rather than a simple list of skills. Our students can
    easily talk with adults. They have a focus and clearness derived from years of
    negotiating a complex and ever-changing society. 

    Once admitted, they also do not seem to have problems with the courses. While
    they may have never taken a course before, they are well-equipped to learn
    what they need to learn in order to succeed at college. They can easily talk
    with professors and resource centers. They work hard at it as they know why
    they are there. 

    They are also not distracted by the social scene at college. They have have
    had many years of socializing and that is not the novelty of college for them.
    For Sudbury students, college is a place to learn academic material that they
    believe will be of use to them in their chosen path in life. Thus, they work
    hard.

* accreditation?

    We are a licensed and recognized school in Maryland. Our standing suffices
    to meet the obligatory attendance requirement for school.

    We are not accredited. To be accredited, we would need to follow a
    standardized curriculum which is antithetical to our model. 

    Accreditation may matter for certain goals, such as playing in collegiate
    athletics. Even here, however, there may be options such as participating
    in an online accredited school.    

* screen time? 

    Students use computers quite a bit. Some parents have issues with that.
    Let us be clear. We will not limit student screen time.

    We trust students to choose an appropriate path to mastering what they
    feel they need to master. Playing is how they learn and that is no
    different on a computer. We all know that computer skills are absolutely
    essential in the current economy. What better way to become comfortable
    with their use than by 

* adult guidance?

Case-by-case basis. They need to be able to be independent, safely so, handle their own needs, not need an adult caretaker, etc.  They must be able to
