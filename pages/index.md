Children are amazing people. They are little bundles of energy, exploring life and all of its many complexities. 

Left to their own devices, they create parallel worlds to the adult world where they practice the skills of adulthood in fun ways via playing. They practice communication and problem-solving, leadership, creativity, reading and writing and math.


They also practice the gamut of human emotions. When interacting freely with others, their joint journeys will guide them through moments of joy, sadness, compassion, anger, and all the other emotions that take so many years to master.

How do we know all this? Because we see this every day at our school. Our children are given he freedom to be children and thus they learn to be adults. They make heir own decisions as to when to eat, what to do, and how to fit into their own authentic community. 

The staff at the school ensure that the school environment is safe and appropriately supportive. All members of the community learn from one another; there is no distinction between teacher and learner. 

Our school is run in a democratic fashion. Students and staff are equals in this school, both deciding on what the rules are as well as adjudicating the rules. We have found that children of all ages treat this process seriously, balancing the needs of the community, as reflected in the rules, with wise compassion to the defendants and plaintiffs. These rich discussions generally lead to respectful outcomes for all involved.  

Learning at this school varies tremendously from person to person and moment to moment. The apparent learning of students might be gymnastics, programming, fort building, mathematics, painting, video editing, musical instrument playing, wood working, writing, dancing, storytelling, history, reading, Minecraft-ing, and whatever else delights their fancy.

But that apparent layer of learning masks the core of what they are truly learning, which is how to learn. This is the key to understanding how generations of Sudbury students, many of which never take a formal class before college, thrive at college. They have learned how to focus, how to explore, how to ask questions, and how to take failure as well as success in stride as just steps towards their ultimate goal, whatever that may be. 

Explore our website to see and understand how we honor children while they prepare for a full, meaningful, satisfying life as adults. 

Our site is organized as follows: 

* The Sudbury Model. We cover the basics of the model here, a model which has been practiced by Sudbury Valley School since the later 1960s with a well-documented track record of generational success of their students.
* Experiences. Learn more about our community through their own eyes and words.
* Frequently Asked Questions. Our approach is very different from teacher focused educational methods. Many people have questions and we believe it is helpful to hear those questions and our answers. 
* School. This is specifically about our history, our building, and our staff.  It is important to be comfortable with the environment in this model. 
* Admissions. Ready to investigate further? Learn what the next steps are.  As with everything else about this school, it is not your typical admissions process.
* Facebook Page. We post random moments and pictures occasionally here as insights into what a day is like. We also post external links to interesting ideas and experiences. 
* Blog. These are more in-depth articles by us with reflections of our days and the model.

Arts&Ideas Sudbury School (A&I) is a school that prepares students for all
aspects of life. It does this by providing a safe and supportive environment
while letting students direct their own days. The community's
self-organization is a key component to the authenticity and adherence to our
many rules. 

A&I is an excellent preparation for any future life endeavor. The skills of
independent learning and community navigation are exactly the skills one needs
in life whether it involves colleges, trade schools, entrepreneurial pursuits,
or immediate entrance to the workforce.

Preparing for future life in a safe, energetic environment is what this school
provides. This works for almost any student though it is critical that the
family believes in the student thriving.
