There are a variety of ways you can support Arts & Ideas. Thank you to all our
supporters, big and small - without the help of our generous community we
would certainly not be the school we are today. 

Donate to A&I via PayPal 

Arts & Ideas is a nonprofit organization and all donations are tax-deductible.
Monetary donations are used to support our financial aid program and for day
to day school operations (like refreshing art supplies or buying seeds for the
garden).
