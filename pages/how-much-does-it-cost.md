How much does it cost?
---

Current tuition is $6,125 for the first student in a family, $4,595 for the
second, and $3,450 for each additional student.

We do have a Financial Aid program for eligible enrolled families.

Additionally, the school requires families to participate in our Parent Equity
Program. We discuss the details of this program in the interview.
This is what allowed the community to support and fund the purchase of 
the school's permanent home. 

### Payment policy

Students may enroll at any time during the school year, subject to
availability. In order to build a stable environment at the school and a
successful experience for each student, it is important that each family trust
the process of self-initiated learning and commit to the long-term process of
community building. Accordingly, we emphasize the importance that all students
and parents must be willing to commit to the school for the duration of the
academic year. Students often need time to adjust to a new environment and
different expectations.

While we encourage families to remit payment for the full year’s tuition upon
enrollment, we understand the preference for some families to participate in
one of our two monthly installment payment plans. Since A&I is a small school,
continued operations rely heavily upon timely payment of tuition by all
attending families. Accordingly, a late fee will be charged for all late
payments. As we truly enjoy seeing our students every day, we request that
families keep their account current so that the student’s do not need to
disrupt their attendance.

### Assembly

The general financial decisions are decided by majority
vote of the Arts & Ideas Assembly - composed of students, parents, and staff -
in its spring meeting.

This includes setting th tuition, the parent equity requirement, and the
budgeted amount of financial aid.
