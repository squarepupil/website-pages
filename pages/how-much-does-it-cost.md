How much does it cost? 
---


There are two main financial obligations to enrolling at Arts & Ideas: tuition
and the Parent Equity Program. Besides these costs, there are no other
mandatory financial obligations to enrolling (no textbook or uniform fees, for
example).

### Tuition 

Current tuition is $6,125 per year for the first child in a family, $4,595
for the second, and $3,450 for any additional children. Tuition is decided
each year by majority vote of the Arts & Ideas Assembly which consists
of parents, staff, and students. For students enrolling part way through
the school year, tuition is prorated to reflect the amount of school time
they will be using. 


### Parent Equity Program

The Parent Equity Program is a capital raising program designed to facilitate
the schoolâ€™s move from its former rented location to the current owned
facilities (as of November 2015). The program was formulated by
the A&I Assembly with the help of a consultant exclusively specializing in
independent schools.  As approved by the
Assembly, participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all
enrolled families. The program is very similar to ones that many other
self-funding schools use; the details of the PEP are discussed during the
family interview. 

### Payment Plans

While the enrollment contract holds each family accountable for full tuition
payments, we do have the flexibility to offer payment plans for those that
need or prefer them. Typically, we offer two plans: a 9 month plan where
families pay a chunk of tuition monthly during the school year only, or a 12
month plan where families can pay less per month by spreading payments out
over the summer. We work with each family individually to figure out the best
solution for everyone. 

### Financial Aid

Arts & Ideas is committed to making our school available and accessible to all
families who are ready to enroll and thus have a financial aid program
available to enrolled and eligible families. Financial aid is handled on a
private, case by case basis by our Financial Aid Committee.
