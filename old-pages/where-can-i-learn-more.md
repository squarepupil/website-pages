### Sudbury Valley School

School Matters - Tomorrow's Teacher, Tomorrow's School

Explore the innovations and trends that could bring about the biggest
transformation in teaching since the beginning of mass education.

Sudbury Valley School Online Library (sudval.org) At Sudbury Valley School,
students from preschool through high school age explore the world freely, at
their own pace and in their own unique ways. They learn to think for
themselves, and learn to use Information Age tools to unearth the knowledge
they need from multiple sources. They develop the ability to make clear
logical arguments, and deal with complex ethical issues. Through
self-initiated activities, they pick up the basics; as they direct their
lives, they take responsibility for outcomes, set priorities, allocate
resources, and work with others in a vibrant community.

### A Mathematician's Lament 

A Mathematician's Lament, was written by Paul
Lockhart in 2002. Mr. Lockhart is a mathematics teacher at Saint Ann's School
in Brooklyn, New York. The Mathematical Association of America featured "A
Mathematicians Lament" in a column by mathematician Keith Devlin who is the
Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Language and Information at
Stanford University and The Math Guy on NPR's Weekend Edition.

"And there you have it. A complete prescription for permanently disabling
young minds— a proven cure for curiosity. What have they done to mathematics!
There is such breathtaking depth and heartbreaking beauty in this ancient art
form. How ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the antithesis of
creativity. They are missing out on an art form older than any book, more
profound than any poem, and more abstract than any abstract. And it is school
that has done this! What a sad endless cycle of innocent teachers inflicting
damage upon innocent students. We could all be having so much more fun."
