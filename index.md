## Arts & Ideas Sudbury School

Arts & Ideas is a school that provides a [safe](safety.html) and [supportive](supportive.html] environment for our students to learn through individualized exploration.

Our students have the freedom to explore anything that interests them. They can delve as deeply into any subject or activity as they wish without interference or judgement.

Students are free to mix with any of their diverse fellow students whose ages range from 5 to 18. They form community and learn to balance their desires with the desires of others. They get to witness the power of cooperation to achieve more than what could be achieved alone. 

We are very much rooted in an entreprenuerial spirit in which drive, independence, community, cooperation, and exploration are practiced constantly. 

A large part of this naturally flows from the democratic spirit of the school. Students and staff make rules and enforce them. These rules are meaningful and are strongly embraced by all of us.

At its core, our democratic education teaches understanding, compromise, and compassion for others. It is very far from the winner-loser model found in dysfunctional models of democracy and education. At Arts&Ideas, our democratic education brings us all closer together.

A profoundly important aspect of our community is that of support and safety. Our whole community looks after one another. If someone needs help, respectful help appears from all sides. No one worries about fitting in. We are all ourselves and we all look for opportunities to incorporate the diversity we find in others in our activities. 

The model we follow was first pioneered in 1968 by [Sudbury Valley School](http://www.sudval.org/) and has been quite successful. The focus is on learning rather than teching and curriculum. We are confident that in this information age, the advantages of this style of education will become ever more apparent.

Our school is based on a philosophy of education first pioneered by the Sudbury Valley School in 1968 and now operating in more than 30 schools worldwide. Arts & Ideas approaches schooling from the learner's point of view, turning conventional education on its head.

We believe that children are the most motivated learners around and that learning happens as a glorious by-product of being human. It happens in an environment that is challenging, supportive and attuned to the idiosyncratic leaps and meanders of authentic exploration. Facts, dates, formulas and skills stick when there is interest and ownership. We recognize a wide variety of paths to knowing and learning.

We operate as a democratic community managed by the students and the staff. Our students master self-determination, responsibility and citizenship. These are the tools that propel one forward and build a capacity for life-long learning and achievement.

Creativity is a natural function of the human brain. We see this in our children's art which serves as their native language and as a way of exploring and understanding the world. This creative intelligence is the core skill for thriving in the contemporary world. It drives intellectual pursuit and enterprise. At Arts & Ideas, students engage with the creative process of living life on their own terms:

a working democracy: students and teachers together make the rules and manage day to day activities

kid-powered: students and teachers explore at their own pace, unhurried and free from an institutionalized curriculum

viral learning: a peer culture of overlapping enthusiasms and expertise

community-based: our neighborhood in all its richness is an extension of our classroom

There's no other school quite like this in Baltimore.
