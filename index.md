## Arts & Ideas Sudbury School

Arts & Ideas is a non-profit private school that specializes in preparing students for a satisfying and productive life. 

Our students have the freedom to explore anything that interests them. They can delve as deeply into any subject or activity as they wish. 

They are free to mix with any of our diverse students whose ages range from 5 to 18. They form community and learn to balance their desires with the desires of others. They get to witness the power of cooperation to achieve more than what could be achieved alone. 

We are very much rooted in an entreprenuerial spirit in which drive, independence, community, cooperation, and exploration are practiced constantly. 

A large part of this lies in the democratic spirit of the school. Students and staff together make rules and enforce them. These rules are meaningful and strongly embrace 

for ages 5 through 18 that prepares students for a life in the 21st century by providing a supportive and stimulating community to allow them to practice all the life skills that are so critical to a satisfying and productive life. 




Our school is based on a philosophy of education first pioneered by the Sudbury Valley School in 1968 and now operating in more than 30 schools worldwide. Arts & Ideas approaches schooling from the learner's point of view, turning conventional education on its head.

We believe that children are the most motivated learners around and that learning happens as a glorious by-product of being human. It happens in an environment that is challenging, supportive and attuned to the idiosyncratic leaps and meanders of authentic exploration. Facts, dates, formulas and skills stick when there is interest and ownership. We recognize a wide variety of paths to knowing and learning.

We operate as a democratic community managed by the students and the staff. Our students master self-determination, responsibility and citizenship. These are the tools that propel one forward and build a capacity for life-long learning and achievement.

Creativity is a natural function of the human brain. We see this in our children's art which serves as their native language and as a way of exploring and understanding the world. This creative intelligence is the core skill for thriving in the contemporary world. It drives intellectual pursuit and enterprise. At Arts & Ideas, students engage with the creative process of living life on their own terms:

a working democracy: students and teachers together make the rules and manage day to day activities

kid-powered: students and teachers explore at their own pace, unhurried and free from an institutionalized curriculum

viral learning: a peer culture of overlapping enthusiasms and expertise

community-based: our neighborhood in all its richness is an extension of our classroom

There's no other school quite like this in Baltimore.
