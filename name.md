Our Name
---
The name Arts&Ideas speaks to a very general and broad scope of human
endeavour. We view Art more broadly than what an art school might call art. 

For us, the art we focus on is the art of doing. The rhythm of children
learning is one of motion, of dance, of beauty in the moment. It is something
quite breathtaking to behold. This is art in its most basic state, the state
upon which the art of painting, of music, of mathematics, of science, of
acting, of orating, of, well, any creative endeavor, is built on. 

The idea part of it is the driving force that starts the doing. It is here
that community is essential. Our students soak up everything that is going on
around them and then they get the inspiration by playing around with what they
observe. This is an important learning method that we all use throughout our
lives.

We observe, we mimic, we modify, we learn. This is what Arts&Ideas is all about.
