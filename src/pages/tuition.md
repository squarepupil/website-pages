Tuition 
---

There are two main financial obligations to enrolling at Arts & Ideas, tuition
and the Parent Equity Program. Besides these costs, there are no other
mandatory financial obligations to enrolling (no textbook or uniform fees, for
example).

## Tuition 

 Current tuition is $6,125 per year for the first child in a family, $4,595
 for the second, and $3,450 for any additional children. Tuition is decided
 each year by majority vote of the Arts & Ideas Assembly, which consists of
 parents, staff, and students. As Arts & Ideas enrolls throughout the year,
 tuition is prorated.

## Parent Equity Program

The Parent Equity Program is a capital raising program designed to facilitate
the schoolâ€™s move from its former rented location to the current owned
facilities (as of November 2015). The School Assembly, which includes parents,
staff, and students, came together and, in consultation with an independent
schools specialist, developed this program. As specified by School Assembly,
participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all enrolled
families. Details of the PEP are discussed during the family interview
step of the enrollment process.

## Payment Plans

While the enrollment contract entails obligation of payment for the full
school year on signature, we do have the flexibility to offer payment plans
for those that need or prefer them. Typically, we offer two plans: a 9 month
plan in which families pay a chunk of tuition during each month of the school
year (Sept-May), or a 12 month plan in which families can pay less per month
by spreading tuition out over additional summer payments. We work with each
family individually to figure out the best solution for each case.

## Financial Aid

Arts & Ideas is committed to making our school accessible to families who are
ready to enroll, thus we have a financial aid program available to enrolled
and eligible families. Financial aid is handled on a private, case by case
basis by our Financial Aid Committee.
