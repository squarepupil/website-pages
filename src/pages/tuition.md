Financial Obligations

There are two main financial obligations to enrolling at Arts & Ideas, tuition
and the Parent Equity Program. Besides these costs, there are no other
mandatory financial obligations to enrolling (for example, no textbooks, uniforms,
or other fees).

Current tuition is $6,125 per year for the first child in a family, $4,595 
for the second child, and $3,450 for any additional children. Tuition is decided
each year by majority vote of the School Assembly, which consists of parents, staff, 
and students. As Arts & Ideas enrolls throughout the year, tuition is prorated.

## Parent Equity Program

The Parent Equity Program is a capital raising program that made possible the school's 
move from its former rented location to its current owned facilities in November 2015.
Participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all enrolled families. 
Arts & Ideas is partnered with a lender whose financing, if needed, includes 
an option that would be expected to raise the nominal tuition of $6,125 
to an effective tuition of $7,900 (rates may vary).

Details of the PEP are discussed during the family interview step of
the enrollment process. 

## Payment Plans

While the enrollment contract entails obligation of payment for the full
school year on signature, we have the flexibility to offer payment plans
for families that need or prefer them. Typically, we offer two plans: a 9 month
plan in which families pay tuition installments during each month of the school
year (Sept-May), or a 12 month plan in which families can pay less per month
by spreading tuition out over additional summer payments. We work with each
family individually to figure out the best solution for each case.

## Financial Aid

Arts & Ideas has a financial aid program available to enrolled and eligible families. 
Financial aid is handled on a private, case by case basis by our Financial Aid Committee.
