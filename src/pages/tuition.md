Tuition

There are two main financial obligations to enrolling at Arts & Ideas, tuition and the Parent Equity Program. Besides these costs, there are no other mandatory financial obligations to enrolling (no textbook or uniform fees, for example).

Tuition 
    Current tuition is $6,125 per year for the first child in a family, $4,595 for the second, and $3,450 for any additional children. Tuition is decided each year by majority vote of the Arts & Ideas Assembly, which consists of parents, staff, and students. As Arts & Ideas enrolls throughout the year, tuition is prorated..

Parent Equity Program
The Parent Equity Program is a fundraising program designed to facilitate the schoolâ€™s move from its former rented location to the current owned facilities (as of November 2015). The program was formulated for the school by a consultant exclusively specializing in independent schools and honed and approved by a vote of the School Assembly (the decision making body which includes parents). As specified by School Assembly, participation in the Parent Equity Program is mandatory for all enrolled families. Further details of the PEP are discussed during the family interview step of the enrollment process.

Payment Plans
    While the enrollment contract entails obligation of payment for the full school year on signature, we do have the flexibility to offer payment plans for those that need or prefer them. Typically, we offer two plans: a 9 month plan in which families pay a chunk of tuition during each month of the school year (Sept-May), or a 12 month plan in which families can pay less per month by spreading tuition out over additional summer payments. We work with each family individually to figure out the best solution for each case.

Financial Aid
    Arts & Ideas is committed to making our school accessible to families who are ready to enroll, thus we have a financial aid program available to enrolled and eligible families. Financial aid is handled on a private, case by case basis by our Financial Aid Committee.
