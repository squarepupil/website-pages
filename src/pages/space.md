Our Space

After seven years of developing a strong community and searching long and
hard, Arts & Ideas acquired a fantastic building in the Fall of 2015. Our main
building is about 12,000 square feet spaced over 4 floors. We are ADA
complaint with an elevator for those in need of one. 

As you walk into the building from Holder Avenue, you will see on your right a
fully stocked library that also serves as a quiet study space. On the left is
our office, often busy with students and staff coming and going. Going further
down the hall is our spacious dining room with a commercial kitchen that our
kitchen corporation uses. Down in our basement, we have a recreation area and
our lockers.

Upstairs, you will find students playing games like Minecraft or practicing
coding skills in our computer lab, rehearsing advanced gymnastics techniques
in our gym room, and flexing their creativity by making extraordinary projects
in the art room, or recording stop animation movies and youtube videos in the
video recording studio. There is also plenty of versatile hang out spaces that
are perfect for impromptu board games, science experiments, or simply spending
time with friends. The second floor also is where you will find our Judicial
Committee and School Meeting when they are in session.

Most of our musical instruments, including guitars, a drum set, and piano, as well
as music recording equipment are housed in the neighboring carriage house,
another building on the property that is about 900 square feet. We love having
the music room in a separate building so that all the musicians at our school
can rock out as loud as they want to! We also intend for the carriage house to
be the future site of our woodworking area.

Our property also has the wonderful and rare combination of both ample green
space and access to urban resources. The field is like a blank canvas - a full
acre of flat, green grass just waiting to be transformed into a natural
playscape right in Baltimore City. The surrounding neighborhood provides safe,
residential streets that are perfect for casual strolls on warmer days.  We
are also less than half a mile from local businesses such as Zekeâ€™s Coffee and
Red Canoe Cafe on Harford Road.

We would love to show you our
beautiful campus - come check it out at our next open house! [link to open
