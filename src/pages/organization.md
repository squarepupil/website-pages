Our Structure

## School Meeting

The overarching governing body of the school is School Meeting, which is
comprised of all enrolled students and staff. Hence, each member of the school
is called a School Meeting Member, or SMM. School Meeting convenes weekly 
to vote on decisions related to running the school, such as rule changes,
spending proposals, visitor approvals, election matters, and difficult
judicial cases. Every SMM can cast one vote in every decision, regardless
of the type or magnitude of the decision.

## Judicial Committee

While School Meeting creates and amends the rules and policies of the school
as needed, Judicial Committee (JC) enforces all the rules in the law book.
Similar to jury duty, a rotating group of students and staff serve together on
JC for one week at a time. Serving on JC is a requirement of all SMMs, from
the 5 year olds to the staff. JC meets every day to handle cases, or "write
ups." When any SMM (child or adult) believes that another SMM (child or adult)
has broken a rule from the law book, the plaintiff writes up a grievance form
and records details of the incident. 

The case is usually heard the next day in JC, which is run much like a small court:

* all testimony from both sides is heard,
* evidence is presented,
* JC decides on what, if any, rules were actually broken, and
* JC also decides on the consequences such as a
warning, cleaning up a mess, or being banned from a room.

The process is designed to make sure all involved understand and appreciate
the rules involved. The sentences are chosen with a goal of restorative
justice. 

## School Assembly

The third governing body of the school is called School Assembly, which
consists of all School Meeting Members (students and staff) and parents. The
School Assembly votes on decisions beyond the day-to-day running of the
school, such as tuition and staff salary. The School Assembly meets at least
once a year. In the annual spring meeting, Assembly discusses and approves the
school budget in addition to any other pressing needs. 

## Clerkships

Much of the schoolâ€™s day-to-day administrative needs are managed by clerks.
Clerks are elected officials within the school who are designated to handle
one particular duty impacting the whole school community. Some examples of
clerkships are Admissions Clerk, Attendance Clerk, PR Clerk, Buildings Clerk,
and Grounds Clerk. Most clerkships may be held by students or staff and are
generally elected yearly; some clerkships, such as Finance Clerk or Medical
Clerk, may only be held by staff for legal reasons. SM Clerk and JC Clerk, who
are elected monthly, preside over School Meeting and Judicial Committee,
respectively. 

## Corporations

Corporations are groups of School Meeting Members that are given authority
over a specific non-essential sphere of activity (e.g., cooking, electronics,
gymnastics, etc.) and generally have a budget approved by School Meeting.
Rather than legislated by the entire school, the governance of a corporation
and its domain is done directly by those involved.

## Staff

Staff are adults entrusted with ensuring the continued existence of the school
and the safety of all School Meeting Members. Every year, all SMMs vote on
whether to rehire each staff member for the following year. This is a true
vote, taken with great care by all involved. Children seem to know when an
adult is both useful to the school and respectful to all SMMs. Staff do not
try to curry favor nor inflict control over children; their task is to
maintain the community and to be authentic in their interactions with all.
