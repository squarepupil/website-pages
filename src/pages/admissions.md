Admissions
---

We encourage families considering enrollment at Arts & Ideas to attend an open
house, especially if they are unfamiliar with our model of education. To
access a current open house schedule, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rbowCIad1VC8l_GOoP-0gcIBhH8DXWnw1RzbobY6q4w/viewform)!

Step 1:  Research

If you can't make an Open House, it is essential that you familiarize yourself
with our educational approach before you come to an interview.  Our website,
and the links, are a good place to start. If, after looking through our site,
you would like to learn more, please email us, and we can send you some
additional links, and perhaps answer some preliminary questions. 

Step 2: Schedule an interview

The interview is a chance not only for us to get to know you and your
family, but for you to get to know us and ask us questions about the
school. You will also get a tour of the space, and since interviews
take place during the school day, you will get to see the school
“in action.” Interviews typically last about an hour, but we are happy to
take as much time as you need to make sure all questions are answered.
Email, at aisudburyschool@gmail.com, is the preferred way to schedule an
interview, but you are also welcome to schedule via phone at 410-426-0001.
There is a $40 interview fee.

Step 3: Visiting week

Once the interview has been completed, the next step towards enrollment is
the visiting week - where the student wishing to enroll attends school for
5 full days (typically Monday-Friday). At the end of the visiting week,
the Admissions Clerks will meet with your family again to debrief - answer
any questions that came up, talk about surprises or expectations that were
met or not met, and to discuss if full enrollment is a good next step.
There is a $125 visiting week fee (prorated tuition for one week of
school). 

Step 4: Enrollment

The enrollment contract is only signed once the visiting week and follow up
meeting have been conducted. Students may enroll at any time during the school
year, subject to availability. In order to build a stable environment at the
school and a successful experience for each student, it is important that each
family trust the process of self-initiated learning and commit to the
long-term process of community building. Accordingly, we emphasize the
importance that all students and parents must be willing to commit to the
school for the duration of the academic year, which our contract reflects.
