The Admissions Process
---

We encourage families considering enrollment at Arts & Ideas to attend an open
house, especially if they are unfamiliar with our model of education. Students 
may enroll at any time during the school year, subject to availability. To access 
a current open house schedule, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rbowCIad1VC8l_GOoP-0gcIBhH8DXWnw1RzbobY6q4w/viewform)!

Step 1:  Research

If you can't make an Open House, it is essential that you familiarize yourself
with our educational approach before you come to an interview.  Our website,
and its links, are a good place to start. If, after looking through our site,
you would like to learn more, please email us, and we can send you some
additional links, and perhaps answer some preliminary questions. 

Step 2: Schedule an interview

The interview is a chance for us to get to know you and your
family, and for you to get to know us and ask us questions about the
school. You will get a tour of the space, and since interviews
take place during the school day, you will get to see the school
“in action.” Interviews typically last about an hour, but we are happy to
take as much time as you need to make sure all questions are answered.
Email, at aisudburyschool@gmail.com, is the preferred way to schedule an
interview, but you are also welcome to schedule via phone at 410-426-0001.
There is a $40 interview fee.

Step 3: Visiting week

Once the interview has been completed, the next step towards enrollment is
the visiting week - where the student, who wishes to enroll, attends school 
for 5 full days (typically Monday-Friday). At the end of the visiting week, 
there is a follow up meeting. The Admissions Clerks will meet with your family 
to debrief - answer any new questions, talk about surprises or expectations 
that were met or not met, and to discuss if full enrollment is a good next step.
There is a $125 visiting week fee (prorated tuition for one week of
school). 

Step 4: Enrollment

The final step is the signing of the enrollment contract, only after the visiting
week and the follow up meeting have been conducted. The enrollment contract is for 
the entire school year, or for the remaining duration if enrolled during the school 
year. In order to build a stable environment at the school and a successful experience 
for each student, it is important that each family trusts the process of self-initiated 
learning and commits to the long-term process of community building.
