FAQ

### Is there homework?

No, there is no homework. Arts & Ideas is a democratic school that does not 
impose curricular tasks of any kind upon students. With that said, students often
fluidly carry on self-initiated projects back and forth between home and
school. Learn more in [The Model](model.html).

### How is the school governed and run?

Arts & Ideas is governed by bodies of students and staff empowered by the
school’s bylaws to manage the school’s operation. See more in [Our
Structure](our-structure.html).

### Is the school similar to any other educational models?

Please see our [Okay, so you’re sort of like…](comparisons.html) page for a
brief comparison of school philosphies.

### How much does it cost?

Please see our [Tuition](tuition.html) page.

### Is financial aid available?

Yes, Arts & Ideas offers need-based financial aid to those who apply to help
offset tuition.

### What is the school’s yearly schedule?

Arts & Ideas operates with a schedule that is similar to neighboring public schools 
and includes winter break, spring break, and summer vacation. See our
[calendar](calendar.html) for more information.

### What are the attendance requirements?

Arts & Ideas is open from 8:15 AM - 5:45 PM. A full day's attendance is a total 
of at least 5 hours, which must include the core hours of 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM.
A&I also offers extended drop-off and pick-up hours from 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
for an additional fee for those families who consistently require it.

### When can we enroll?

Arts & Ideas enrolls throughout the year. Please see our [Admissions](admissions.html)
page for more information.

### Does the school serve meals?

No, Arts & Ideas does not serve meals. Most students bring lunches from home.
Our off-campus policy facilitates students buying lunch from nearby
restaurants and shops.

### Is transportation provided?

No, Arts & Ideas does not provide transportation to and from school each day. Since 
our families live all over the Baltimore area, some families utilize 
carpooling arrangements for daily school commuting. 

### Is there a daily schedule?

Aside from a few established activities that run on schedule (Judicial 
Committee every day at 11:30, chore time every day at 2:30, and School Meeting 
on Tuesdays at 1:00), the students have no set schedules other than what they might 
decide to make for themselves. Thus, daily personal activities at A&I vary 
widely from student to student, day to day, and can include:

outdoor play (climbing trees in the yard/running/cartwheels/playing games), 
using computers (playing Minecraft/coding/editing videos/research), 
creating (music/stories/books/art/dollhouses), 
organizing (a bake sale/play audition/holiday parties),
spending time on one's own (reading/thinking/making art/just observing),
socializing (laughing/talking/listening/sharing).

### Do you accept students with disabilities?

Yes, Arts & Ideas enrolls students with disabilities on a case-by-case basis; however,
A&I does not provide any specific accommodations for students with disabilities.
Regardless of any disability, all students must be able to keep themselves safe 
without constant adult supervision and take care of their own needs (such as eating 
and using the restroom). 

In many ways, every student at A&I is on their own IEP (Individualized Education Plan), 
in that they have the space, time, and freedom to be themselves and learn in whatever 
way makes sense for them. Students who have been diagnosed with Autism, Dyslexia, ADD, 
ADHD, Emotional or other Mood disorders, among others, have achieved great success at
A&I.

### What resources are available at school?

The resources at Arts & Ideas include: 

Music Room (with many instruments, recording equipment, amplifiers)
Art Room (different kinds of art supplies for painting and crafting)
Video Room (for recording stop animation shorts or live action videos)
Kitchen (commercial kitchen stocked with pizza ovens and a deep fryer)
Library (lots of books, including Sudbury-related books for parents)
Gymnastics Area (kip bar, practice balance beam, yoga and gymnastics mats).

Some of the resources available at A&I ebb and flow, based on current
student interests. Please see [Our Space](our-space.html) for pictures and 
more information about our facilities.

### Are there field trips?

Yes, Arts & Ideas offers field trips. Some trips are primarily planned
and executed by staff, while others are largely coordinated by students. Some
of our past field trips include: taking the light rail to the Baltimore Aquarium, 
listening to all kinds of concerts at Peabody, seeing plays at The Baltimore Theatre 
Project, exploring for treasures at nearby Herring Run Park, overnight camping at a 
beach in Delaware, and engaging in all kinds of outdoor fun at Camp Puh’Tok. 

### Is A&I an arts school?

Yes, but in a more subtle way than most expect.  Please see the [Our
Story](our-story.html) page for a more in-depth explanation of our name.

### Do students receive a diploma?

Yes, Arts & Ideas grants its own diploma for students who write and defend a thesis.
A&I diploma is not a high school equivalence diploma; however, it is a document that 
students can and do use for college and job applications. 

Please see our [I get it, but what about…?](confusions.html) page for more information 
about colleges and careers for Sudbury graduates.

### How does graduation work?

Arts & Ideas, like most Sudbury Schools, offers an optional diploma process for students 
aged 16+: a thesis is written to address the question ‘How have I prepared to enter the 
world beyond school?’ and defended in front of a panel of staff members from neighboring
Sudbury schools.

Students who are of age to leave A&I may graduate without the diploma. Many, but not all, 
teenagers choose to undertake the optional diploma process, often as a capstone of their 
school experience.

### What is the school’s legal structure?

Arts & Ideas is a church-exempt non-public school under the auspices of the
Arcadian Fellowship Church. The Arcadian Fellowship is a non-denominational
non-profit created alongside the school and its mission is to support democratic
education for all children. The Arcadian Fellowship does not make decisions
pertaining to the school’s day to day operation.
