## ... reading?

++Children learn to read on their own on their own schedule.++

Children learn to read on their own. As with any new skill, when 
children are interested and motivated, learning happens...and that journey 
will be unique for each child. Some children learn to read early and others 
learn much later. Once reading starts, it may progress slowly or surprisingly 
quickly.

We live in a literate society, in which reading and writing are necessary skills.
Demanding that these skills are attained on "schedule" creates unnecessary pressure.
Allowing children to aquire these skills at their own pace fosters positive 
attitudes about learning.

[Peter Gray’s “Children Teach Themselves to
Read”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read)
offers excellent perspective on children learning to read on their own. One 
interesting observation is that the starting age of reading, whether early or 
late, has no bearing on future reading intests or abilities.

## ... math?

++Arithmetic is important in daily life so that children learn that. They develop the skills needed to appreciate abstract mathematics if it ever comes up.++

As with reading, children learn basic arithmetic, because it is a useful skill.
Whether dealing with food, toys, games, or money, counting or sharing is involved.
Children assimilate math concepts from using numbers in these very natural contexts.

Children also study advanced mathematics as needed to achieve specific goals. To 
prepare for college entrance exams, they seek resources for self-study and often find
that they can grasp all the material relatively quickly in a few months. They learn to
view math as a tool that they can master, rather than as a subject to be feared or 
dreaded for years.

on their own.

## ... getting into college?

++If a student wishes to go to college, they are well-equipped to make the case and perform well when they do go.++

!questions-armchair.jpg,, right

As with any other personal goals that they have set for themselves, students with 
college aspirations find ways to be successful. They prepare for necessary tests. 
They complete the prerequisites when possible, or negotiate their way around 
them skillfully. They impress admissions boards with their level of maturity 
and ability to express themselves cogently. 

In several ways, experiences at Arts & Ideas can faciliate the transition to college.
Our students know how to discuss and debate, so they are ready to participate.
They have explored interests and studied independently for years, so they are ready 
to focus on their chosen areas of study. Since they have freely interacted with fellow 
students of all ages and backgrounds, they are not easily distracted by the college 
social scene nor overwhelmed by any newfound freedom.

Sudbury Valley School, founded almost 50 years ago, reports that their graduates
typically seek higher education and succeeed at institutes of higher learning.
At A&I, our two graduates have found fulfilling pursuits: one is studying 
photography at the college of his choice (and he was accepted without a transcript 
and SAT scores) and the other, who apprenticed while attending A&I, is a 
professional pastry chef (his dream job!).

## ... supplementary instruction? 

++If students want instruction, then that can work out at their direction.++

At Arts & Ideas, students have the freedom (and the responsibility) to ... [pursue their
own learning?] As they follow their curiosity and interests, they learn related facts 
and practice useful skills. Thus, supplemental instruction is not needed.

To address specific needs or goals (such as preparing for college entrance
exams), supplemental instuction may sometimes be utilized at home. In keeping
with our school philosophy, it is important that the impetus for classes, homework, 
and other instructional activities is the student.

Learning at A&I is student-driven, individualized, and addresses authentic 
needs and interests. As students discover and pursue their passions,
they achieve higher levels of knowlege and mastery of skills.

## ... screen time?

++Unlimited screen time is allowed at our school++

It is quite possible that your child will spend all day on the computer at
times - and that’s okay! With all of the negative media attention surrounding
screen time, it is not surprising that many parents are concerned about this.
We at Arts & Ideas recognize that computers are the most important tools of
modern society and that there are many proven, studied advantages to playing
with them regularly. Furthermore, computers and gaming are very social
activities at our school in which students engage with each other, learn from
each other, and problem-solve together.

We also find that with everything going on at our school, it is nearly
impossible for any one child to do only one thing, all day, every day,
forever. We see even the screen-obsessed kids (the ones learning to code a new
Minecraft mod, or spending hours working on a tiny animation detail of a new
video), take breaks to challenge themselves to go out of their comfort zone by
climbing a tree or playing a game of soccer. When kids feel comfortable in
their safe space - whether that be near a screen or not - they gain the
confidence in themselves and bravery to try something new. 

## ... teachers? What do the teachers do?

++Adults are just staff. They make sure the school functions and continues to thrive.++

“What I have learned, very slowly and painfully over the years, is that
children make vital decisions for themselves in ways that no adults could have
anticipated or even imagined.” ~ Hanna Greenberg, founder of Sudbury Valley
School, in The Art of Doing Nothing

We have no teachers. The adults employed by the school are staff and are
responsible for the administration and upkeep of the school as delegated to
them by School Meeting. Staff are community elders, subject matter experts,
janitors, advocates, curious students, and responsible School Meeting Members.
Elected positions for staff have them managing finances, administering the
admissions process, tracking attendance, communicating with parents, planning
PR events, cleaning and maintaining the property, and everything that it takes
to run a school. Students may also serve in many of these roles.

As students and staff have equal standing in an institutional sense,
relationships between students and staff tend to be collegial. As in any
community, staff and students will develop closer relationships with those
they have affinity for and will naturally influence each other’s interests and
activities. Staff do not artificially seize “teachable moments” as is often
discussed in conventional educational models, but, like anyone, are certainly
apt to expound on topics they feel passionately about if a student brings it
up.

As adults in the current culture, staff must constantly fight against
unneeded intervention. Our students explorations inevitably lead them to push
past their comfort zone. Emotions flare up and it can be very hard not to rush
in and try to resolve the situation. Just as we would not intervene in adult
conflicts without due cause, we do not intervene in student conflicts without
due cause. It is this, above all else, that a staff at a Sudbury school must
be comfortable with.
