Ok, what about ...

## ... reading?

Children learn to read on their own. As with any new skill, when 
children are interested and motivated, learning happens...and that journey 
will be unique for each child. Some children learn to read early and others 
learn much later. Once reading starts, it may progress slowly or surprisingly 
quickly.

We live in a literate society, in which reading and writing are necessary skills.
Demanding that these skills are attained on "schedule" creates unnecessary pressure.
Allowing children to aquire these skills at their own pace fosters positive 
attitudes about learning.

[Peter Gray’s “Children Teach Themselves to
Read”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read)
offers excellent perspective on children learning to read on their own. One 
interesting observation is that the starting age of reading, whether early or 
late, has no bearing on future reading intests or abilities.

## ... math?

As with reading, children learn basic arithmetic, because it is a useful skill.
Whether dealing with food, toys, games, or money, counting or sharing is involved.
Children assimilate math concepts from using numbers in these very natural contexts.

Children also study advanced mathematics as needed to achieve specific goals. To 
prepare for college entrance exams, they seek resources for self-study and often find
that they can grasp all the material relatively quickly in a few months. They learn to
view math as a tool that they can master, rather than as a subject to be feared or 
dreaded for years.

on their own.

## ... getting into college?

!questions-armchair.jpg,, right

As with any goals that they have set for themselves, students with college 
aspirations find ways to be successful. They prepare for necessary tests. 
They complete the prerequisites when possible, or negotiate their way around 
them skillfully. They impress admissions boards with their level of maturity 
and ability to express themselves cogently. 

Once admitted, students continue to work hard and do well in their courses. They 
may have never taken a formal class before, but they apply all that they know about
learning. They know how to immerse themselves in interests, explore available
resources, and set and achieve their own goals. Nor are they overly distracted by
the social scene or overwhelmed by newfound freedom. 

The experience recounted here is mostly derived from the stories of the nearly
50 year old Sudbury Valley School. They have reported, after conducting
extensive alumni studies, that of the over 80% of their graduates who choose
to pursue higher education, almost all get into their first choice of schools.
For those who do not pursue a college education, the choice is a
self-interested one that allows them to go directly into the field of their
choosing. 

As for A&I, of our two graduates thus far, one is studying photography at the
college of his choice - which he was accepted to without a diploma or SAT
scores - and the other is a professional pastry chef at a high end restaurant
\- his dream job that he apprenticed for while attending A&I.


## ... screen time?

It is quite possible that your child will spend all day on the computer at
times - and that’s okay! With all of the negative media attention surrounding
screen time, it is not surprising that many parents are concerned about this.
We at Arts & Ideas recognize that computers are the most important tools of
modern society and that there are many proven, studied advantages to playing
with them regularly. Furthermore, computers and gaming are very social
activities at our school in which students engage with each other, learn from
each other, and problem-solve together.

We also find that with everything going on at our school, it is nearly
impossible for any one child to do only one thing, all day, every day,
forever. We see even the screen-obsessed kids (the ones learning to code a new
Minecraft mod, or spending hours working on a tiny animation detail of a new
video), take breaks to challenge themselves to go out of their comfort zone by
climbing a tree or playing a game of soccer. When kids feel comfortable in
their safe space - whether that be near a screen or not - they gain the
confidence in themselves and bravery to try something new. 


## ... exposure? How do students know what they don’t know?

We live in the information age, where knowledge is available at your
fingertips. In this context, and especially at a Sudbury school, where
conversation flows freely and without time limits, it would be an enormously
difficult task not to be exposed to all kinds of topics and information.
Because students are free to explore and interact with other students and
adults of all ages with all different backgrounds, they are naturally exposed
to a wide variety of topics.  Students follow their curiosity and interest,
which is not limited to a set curriculum. Have you ever met a young child that
does not like asking questions? At A&I, this curiosity is not squashed when the
child enrolls at school. Instead it is encouraged and allowed to blossom into
all kinds of information exploring and gathering. It is unsurprising then that
when we do hear from parents on the matter of exposure, the question is almost
always “How did my son/daughter know that?”

## ... supplementary instruction?  

Some people immediately see the social value of our school and think they can
fill the perceived academic void by having their child follow an online
curriculum at home, by visiting a weekly tutor, or by engaging in nightly
homeschool-esque lessons with the parent. These kinds of activities are fine,
if and only if it is truly your child’s choice to engage in them. 

However, any
type of academics or extracurricular activity that is forced upon your child
is contrary to our school’s philosophy and will undermine their experience at
school.  Insistence on supplementary activities sends a mixed-message to your
child that school is for playing/socializing and the “real” learning takes
place at home. 

Instead of learning confidence and independence, they learn that they need
others to teach them. Even worse, they learn that they are not capable of
deciding what they need to be taught. 

And they also have to reconcile what the parents say (“We trust
you”), with the lack of trust inherent in dictating what the child ought to be
interested in. This is an extremely difficult place for a child to be put in
and ultimately ends up severely damaging their trust in themselves and renders
their Sudbury school experience an unfulfilled promise.  

This confusion of
educational purpose not only adversely affects the individual child but the
entire school community. The one child who perceives his/her learning
experience at school as either an impossible task at best, or a lie at worst,
will naturally influence peers with that attitude. 

It is the job of the parent
to support their child at a Sudbury school by consistently delivering the
message that what the child chooses to engage in at school is important,
valuable, real learning, and enough. Perhaps even more importantly, the job of
a parent is to just enjoy their time with their child and let them know that their
future is theirs to make.

## ... teachers? What do the teachers do?

“What I have learned, very slowly and painfully over the years, is that
children make vital decisions for themselves in ways that no adults could have
anticipated or even imagined.” ~ Hanna Greenberg, founder of Sudbury Valley
School, in The Art of Doing Nothing

We have no teachers. The adults employed by the school are staff and are
responsible for the administration and upkeep of the school as delegated to
them by School Meeting. Staff are community elders, subject matter experts,
janitors, advocates, curious students, and responsible School Meeting Members.
Elected positions for staff have them managing finances, administering the
admissions process, tracking attendance, communicating with parents, planning
PR events, cleaning and maintaining the property, and everything that it takes
to run a school. Students may also serve in many of these roles. 

!questions-washing.jpg

As students and staff have equal standing in an institutional sense,
relationships between students and staff tend to be collegial. As in any
community, staff and students will develop closer relationships with those
they have affinity for and will naturally influence each other’s interests and
activities. Staff do not artificially seize “teachable moments” as is often
discussed in conventional educational models, but, like anyone, are certainly
apt to expound on topics they feel passionately about if a student brings it
up.

As adults in the current culture, staff must constantly fight against
unneeded intervention. Our students explorations inevitably lead them to push
past their comfort zone. Emotions flare up and it can be very hard not to rush
in and try to resolve the situation. Just as we would not intervene in adult
conflicts without due cause, we do not intervene in student conflicts without
due cause. It is this, above all else, that a staff at a Sudbury school must
be comfortable with.
