Arts & Ideas Parent Testimonials

* [My son] dove out of bed at 5:15 and was bummed to find he couldn't go to
  school for three hours. Then he told me, "I'll make my lunch so you don't
  have to," and considering how he usually acts like making his lunch is the
  burden of all burdens...
    * “My son dove out of bed at 5:15 and was bummed to find he couldn’t go to
  school for three hours”

* [My daughter] is so very happy she woke up at 5:00 AM ASKING IF SHE COULD GO
  TO SCHOOL YET!  I am sure as parents you know how much that means to me;
  there is just no feeling like it.
    * “My daughter woke up at 5:00 AM asking if she could go to school yet! There
  is just no feeling like it.”

* I'll be continuing to support you and spread the word about the school,
  especially now that I've seen it. Congratulations too, I'm so impressed with
  how wonderfully you've all made this space happen and how well you've
  articulated the differences and history of this model.
    * “I’m so impressed with how wonderfully you’ve all made this space happen.”

* We think about you every day since the open house. I am thinking of [my
  son’s] visitation week, and more importantly, [my son] is thinking of his
  visitation week. One of the reasons you've been on the brain so much is, by
  total chance, my son has discovered stop action animation.  Much of his free
  time at home is spent using my camera and moving around his toys, and making
  clay shapes come to life.  Thinking of how this would dovetail with what you
  have available at the school just makes my heart swell....

* His enthusiasm for getting to know more about your school has not waned in
  the past few weeks, so he is very excited to learn more about the school and
  for you to learn more about him!

* Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. You are the main reason why
  I chose Arts & Ideas, just wanted to let you know that. I totally felt at
  ease when we met and sensed an amazing amount of empathy/kindness and
  compassion in you. I want my sprouting bean to be around creative, kind and
  nourishing people, especially at this age. With that said, [my daughter] will be
  thrilled to start this September and we will see you/speak with you when we
  get back home. 
    * “I want my sprouting bean to be around creative, kind, and nourishing
  people.”

* I just want to share that this year has been pivotal for [my son] and I feel
  that A&I has pretty much saved his experience with education.  I think I
  have one of the most balanced, self-motivated and un-cranky teenagers that
  could ever exist! I also want to share that our experience at A&I has
  directly affected my teaching strategy, with teenagers specifically. 
    * “I feel that A&I has pretty much saved [my son’s] experience with education.
  I think I have one of the most balanced, self-motivated, and un-cranky
  teenagers that could ever exist!”

* What image pops into mental view when one hears, yet again, that it takes a
  village to raise a child? A bunch of adults, all available to cast a
  benevolently watchful eye upon whoever’s child happens  to be underfoot as
  they set a virtuous and practical example by going about their business. All
  good. What is missing from this virtual tableau? The sound of small feet
  hurrying, the annoyed sighs of teens deploying their dirt-palmed clean-up
  crew, a chicken coop being raised on academic real estate, music, laughter,
  and all kids raising each other in their real world, in real time, learning
  to own the reality of their actions. To use an adult-shrink-speak term, the
  kids learn “agency” at Arts and Ideas Sudbury School, just ‘cause they can.
  With the tableau thus filled in, the village becomes complete. 
    * “The kids learn “agency” at Arts and Ideas Sudbury School, just ‘cause they
  can.”

* Our daughter's learning style is not a match for a traditional classroom.
  We needed to decide whether we would continue cramming her into a box where
  she didn't fit or give her the space to be herself.  This is her 2nd year at
  Arts & Ideas and she's a much happier kid. Her eyes are bright, her
  curiosity is unstoppable and she loves learning a variety of subjects. -

    * “This is [my daughter’s] 2nd year at Arts & Ideas and she’s a much happier
  kid. Her eyes are bright, her curiosity is unstoppable, and she loves
  learning a variety of subjects.”

* Sometimes people ask how we think [my daughter] will do in "the real world"
  after a Sudbury education.  In the "real world", the pace of technological
  and social change means that successful people need to be continuous
  learners and skilled collaborators, eager to try new things and not too
  worried about whether their experiments will initially fail.  Those are the
  skills that Sudbury nurtures.  Our daughter will be much more prepared for
  "the real world" than most of her traditionally schooled peers.

*  Our change in
  schools was the best decision we have ever made for [my daughter].  She truly is a
  different child!! Thanks for being part of it!! 
  
    Once upon a time, not so
  very long ago, a princess was born to the Kingdom
  of Avondale.  It did not take long for the king and queen to realize that
  this was no ordinary princess.  This princess did not like princess clothes.
  She did not like to participate in activities that other young princesses
  enjoy.  And she hated princess school.  Often it was difficult for this
  princess to just get dressed and leave the castle in the mornings.  She
  fought many battles at her young age.  The kingdom was confused by this
  out-of-the-box princess.  The king and queen summoned all the best
  specialists to come look at their child to understand why she acted
  differently than the other princesses.  Then one day, the king and queen
  found a magic bean.  They planted the magic bean and grew some sense.  Sense
  is a powerful thing! The king and queen removed the princess from princess
  school and enrolled her in a non-traditional school with young lads and
  lassies from neighboring kingdoms.  They told their princess that she did
  not have to grow up to be just like the other princesses.  She could be
  anything and do anything she wanted.  The princess began to flourish.  She
  no longer had difficulty getting dressed and leaving the castle in the
  mornings.  She even started to explore the latest in princess fashions.  The
  princess was happy!  And everyone knows... a happy princess means a happy
  kingdom. Happy, happy birthday my beautiful princess.  May you continue to
  beat to your own drum, let your light shine, and make your own way in the
  world.

* Arts & Ideas saved my kids: I went from worrying about them every second of
  the day to not worrying at all. And once I was totally on board with the
  Sudbury philosophy, I not only didn't worry about their presents, I also
  stopped worrying about their futures.
    * “Arts & Ideas saved my kids.”
    * “I went from worry about [my kids] every second of the day to not worrying
  at all.”

* Even the most innovative of public charter schools has assignments, tests,
  strained teachers, and deadlines. For [my daughter], the stress, anxiety, and
  resentment that came from struggling within those constraints got in the way
  of actual learning. Rather than blossoming, this incredibly bright kid was
  failing. Her “off the charts” intelligence didn’t matter; she felt “stupid”
  and gave up because “success” was based on scores. Her anxiety flared and
  her self-esteem plummeted. She was getting sick at school and struggled
  socially. I’m sorry, but a test score does not equal aptitude! We knew the
  system wasn’t working for her and decided to jump ship.

    What we’ve found at Arts & Ideas is the space to swim on her own terms, in
    her own way, at her own pace. There’s room to breathe, play, stretch, and
    imagine. In just the few months that we’ve been at A&I, I have already
    seen a big change in Dolly’s sense of self. They ebb and flow but the
    confidence and autonomy she could not find are really starting to bubble.
    The chance to look inward as well as outward has provided her with her own
    huge canvas to fill – a scenario she never found herself in while tackling
    public school. The elimination of deadlines has freed her mind (and
    schedule) to discover herself and bloom, which is exactly what one should
    hope to find in any schooling.

    I’m not going to lie – there are bumps in the suddenly open road to a
    teen’s self-sufficiency and the non-accrediting thing scared us a bit
    going in. BUT we had (and continue to have) faith that the pieces missing
    in her public school experience –the independence, the time to focus on
    passions, a fantastic staff that’s always ready and willing to hear
    her—THESE are what we need and what we’ll find in a Sudbury environment.
    And that these things in the forefront will make learning exciting – not
    dreaded.  In the few months we’ve been at A&I, she’s already: plotting RPG
    game designs, playing music, critically thinking about the world around
    her (“Homestuck as the modern day Odyssey” could totally be a college
    course), learning about democracy and judiciary responsibility, filling
    her art portfolio, studying mythology, advocating feminism and social
    justice, making great friendships, and more. Now THAT’S an education!

* Many well meaning friends and family members have questioned what seems like
  an unorthodox educational approach or journey for our family. We began as
  homeschoolers, turned into unschoolers and ended up at Arts and Ideas in
  2008. This has been the best choice we could have made for our family. My
  eldest son was deeply involved in the local homeschooling community and
  loved the direction his education was taking him, and then we attended an
  open house for Arts and Ideas. At what was to be the interview for our 6
  year old, our twelve year old begged for an interview and tour and basically
  pleaded with the founders to have the school allow him an age exception
  since the school was not going to take 12 year olds. Both boys began, with
  me working as staff, in the Fall of 2008, and I can honestly say we have
  never made a better decision as a family.

    My sons have been challenged, inspired, frustrated and stymied by this
    model. Our eldest son graduated from A&I after a senior year where he
    struggled with his thesis( the model's requirement for graduation) and
    balanced an internship with a local bakery. During his time at A&I he
    began to become serious about photography and with this skill he garnered
    a show at a local restaurant and his work hung in numerous local shops. He
    bought his first car with the money he saved in part due to sales of his
    photographs. After graduation at age 16 he went on to certify as one of
    the youngest Wilton instructors in our area, then soon after he began
    working at a local restaurant in Hampden. Le Garage. He has been there two
    years and is the pastry chef, which was what his life goal was beginning
    at 12. He felt prepared to step into adulthood  as he had gained so many
    skills we tend to think of as more "adult" through the processes of School
    Meeting and Judicial Committee.

    Our youngest son has chosen a different path, unlike our eldest who never
    missed a School Meeting or a chance to volunteer for Judicial Committee,
    our youngest is content to follow his own goals. His independence and
    autonomy are his focus and as he was 'raised" in the model we have
    spirited discussions about politics and current events.His separation from
    his brother's approach and years at A&I have also been of great value as
    he stands apart from his brother's choices and expectations. 

    We did not desire report cards or test scores, despite my husband working
    as a teacher for a time; we wanted active thinkers, independence,the
    freedom to explore and a firm sense of self determination. Arts and Ideas
    has supported all of this and opened so many new pathways for our family.
