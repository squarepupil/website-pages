author and research professor, Dr. Peter Gray of Boston College, is a
wonderful resource about education, children, and parenting. His son, Scott
Gray, attended Sudbury Valley School and is now a staff member there. Some of
Dr. Gray's posts, among many, which are related to our type of school are:

## Other schools

There are also a variety of other Sudbury schools whose websites can give a
general flavor of the model. We are all quite independent with unique and
interesting differences, but these are schools that we feel share a similar
vision for running a school. 

* [Fairhaven]() Near Washington D.C. They provided the legal model for our
  school.
* [Philly Free School]() In Philadelphia, this is another urban school similar
  to ours.
* [The Circle School]()  Around since 1984 and in Harrisburg, PA, they are  working to fund a new building. 
* [Sudbury Valley School]() The school that inspired it all since the late
  1960s. 
* [Hudson Valley School]() This has some great videos explaining their school. 

... and many more.
