Arts & Ideas Sudbury School is a 21st-century school in Baltimore where
students ages 5 through 18 learn, explore, and grow in a stimulating,
supportive community.  The school is based on a philosophy of education first
pioneered by the Sudbury Valley School in 1968 and now operating in more than
30 schools worldwide. 

A&I was founded in 2008 by two parents, [Caroline Chavasse](staff.html) and [Danny Mydlack](https://www.towson.edu/cofac/departments/mediafilm/facultystaff/dmydlack.html), also professors, professional artists, and residents of
the Northeast neighborhood where Arts & Ideas began.  Before starting Arts &
Ideas, the founders formed a popular community playgroup for kids under age
five that was inspired by the principles of Sudbury schooling. Children, free
to follow their interests with minimal adult interference, were able to create
their own games and activities as they saw fit while navigating a rich social
scene, i.e, they got to play!

To learn more about the Sudbury model of education, Danny was
hired part-time for a year at the Fairhaven school, another Sudbury school in
Bowie, Maryland. During that time, he shot the documentary, 
[Voices From the New American Schoolhouse](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07664D50ED360355&feature=viewall), 
about the students at Fairhaven, while Caroline ran the
playgroup. 

After countless conversations with parents who said, "I don’t want
to homeschool...but there is not a school I know of that I like,"  the idea of
opening a school evolved into a concrete goal. Through visiting other Sudbury
schools, continuing their research, and gaining hands-on experience, their
understanding of and commitment to the Sudbury model deepened just as the
up-and-coming vibe of their northeast neighborhood grew into a buzz. New
restaurants, coffee shops and a bookstore opened, attracting families from all
over Baltimore. It was a good time and place to open a school.

The school first opened with nine students in the upstairs hall of
the Church of the Messiah in the Hamilton/Lauraville neighborhood in Northeast
Baltimore.  Almost entirely by word of mouth the school quickly grew, and in
the second year it opened with 40 students, at near capacity at the rented
space.  Through the next five years, a search for a larger, more permanent
home ran concurrently as the school culture stabilized and matured. 

Parents, staff and students defined a wish list for the school’s forever home,
which included remaining an urban school, with shops and city culture close
by, while also having an attractive green space. It was not an easy task to find an
affordable place to fit that bill in Baltimore.  As the school's enrollment
approached the limit of the space, the urgency of finding a new location
became the defining issue of the school's seventh year.

Facing the difficult task of buying a property with the resources of fifty
modest families, the community hired a consultant. The consultant, [Reed
Sumida of ISPG](http://www.ispginc.com/group_reed_sumida), specialized
in working with small, independent schools. He guided the community in both
raising the capital and finding the perfect location. The community chose his
innovative plan that used its own resources to fund the purchase of a
beautiful million dollar building and property. The capital plan helped
maintain our low tuition for both current and future families. 

After a year of hard work by parents and
staff, the school purchased a lovely, enhanced property on Holder Avenue
just a mile from the school's original home. This new space is within walking
distance to Red Canoe, Zeke’s, Herring Run Park and other great shops and
stores. It has over an acre of flat green space. 

The school moved to its permanent home at the beginning of December, 2015.
Staff and students made the pilgrimage on foot from the old space to the
new space. Arts & Ideas Sudbury School had triumphantly claimed its home. 

There's no other school quite like this in
Baltimore!
