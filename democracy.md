## A Working Democracy

Our school functions as a democracy. Each School Meeting Member (SMM), student or staff has one vote in our governing body, which we call School Meeting (SM). SM decides on the rules that govern our community. The community decides how our school functions. 

It also enforces the rules. Any SMM can write up another for violating our rules. An individual can, and often does, write themselves up.
