# FAQ

* Why is your tuition so low?

	Traditional schools have a great deal of administrative overhead. We have very little. Our small staff can handle the administrative needs, janitorial needs, mentoring needs, and recruitment needs. A large portion of this is due to the fact that the community of students is self-sustaining. As examples of what is eliminated: 
    
    1. Monitors.  Our students care and support for one another. So instead of one pair of adult eyes, we may have 20 pairs watching with concern and respect. Whenever there is anything that they feel an adult presence is needed for, instantly they get one and service is rendered. We find students to be more protective of each other and more cautious in their own actions than when adults are in charge. They are happy to involve the adults because there is not a punitive attitude in our involvement.
    2. (Vice-)Principals. Our students are the ones who decide the disposition of rule-breaking and punishment. They do so in a sort of jury and it is quite efficient, often eliciting much more truthful statements than would be had by adult interogations. 
    3. Janitors. We have communal chores that do a decent job of cleaning up the wide areas. What remains, such as sanitary cleaning, the staff can handle. 
    4. Teachers. We do not teach at least in the traditional school sense though we do in the ancient traditional sense. We mentor which is a very focused and efficient kind of teaching. Namely, students ask staff and other students for information about something of particular interest. We can answer it readily as we know about what they are asking. We do not need to prepare lesson plans nor do we grade and evaluate their work. And even as mentors, many times other students will be more fitting for that role. 
    
    Our use of adults is very efficient because our whole community is involved in the process of what our school is about. 

* What is your curriculum? 

	We do not have formal curriculum as in most schools. What we do view as a curriculum substitute also does not correspond to a general notion of academic curriculums. 
    Instead, what we have is a structure that supports students exploring the world around them and learning from living. The biggest component of that exploration is their fellow community members. They learn from one another how to interact with each other, how to respect each other, how to advocate for themselves, how to listen to one another, how to have fun, how to cry, how to deal with anger. 
    They also learn the workings of a democracy. It shows them how they can work out disagreements rationally and calmly, how they can mold an environment through communal discussions that is equitable to the many conflicting needs of the community. They learn about fairness and justice, about respect and listening, about empathy and sympathy. 
    The curriculum is summed up in one term: Life. They are living life and learning whatever lessons they need from that experience. 
    
* About democracy, is it really that hard to learn?

	The technical aspects of democracy, such as voting and majority wins, is not particularly difficult to learn. That is not what we mean when we say they are learning democracy though they do get that, of course, from our setup. 
    The main meaning of learning democracy is learning to listen to one another and compromise. It is about being content with not winning, but rather with finding a successful outcome from the debate. This is not easy to learn, but is a trait of people leading both happy and succ

* 	How will my child get into college?

	First, it is important to understand that if you have strong goals for your child that they may not share with you, then it would be beneficial to let those goals now. That is to say, if your child does not want to go to college, then sending them to a Sudbury school will probably not lead to college unless your child changes their mind.
    Second, the critical skills that they will learn here, such as socializing, advocating for themselves, and confidence, will be of critical importance in them not only getting into college, but thriving at it. We have often seen that the acquisition of academic knowledge and skills has taken
